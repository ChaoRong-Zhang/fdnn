This python code is split into three files:

1. NNCancellation.py: This file loads the measured testbed data and performs non-linear cancellation using the neural network based method proposed in [1]. It also plots the PSDs of the resulting signals as well as the cancellation performance.

2. polynomialCancellation.py: This file loads the measured testbed data and performs non-linear cancellation using the baseline polynomial model. It also plots the PSDs of the resulting signals as well as the cancellation performance.

3. fullduplex.py: This file contains all the helper functions that are required to do linear cancellation and non-linear cancellation using the baseline polynomial model and it is imported in both NNCancellation.py and polynomialCancellation.py.
